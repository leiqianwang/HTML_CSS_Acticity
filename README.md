## Partner About-Me Page Activity  

## Overview  
In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an **About-Me Page** about them. This exercise is designed to practice your HTML and CSS skills while learning more about your peers.  

Each partner will create an HTML/CSS-based About-Me page for their partner, including:  
- A **short introduction section** about your partner.  
- A **Two Truths and a Lie section**, where you share two facts and one false statement about your partner (in no particular order).  

You will have **30 minutes** to complete this activity.  

## Instructions  
1. **Pair up with a partner.**  
2. Interview your partner to gather the necessary information for their About-Me page.  
3. Create an HTML file and a CSS file in your personal repository.  
   - Name the HTML file `about_me.html`.  
   - Name the CSS file `style.css`.  

4. **Content Requirements:**  
   - The About-Me page should have:  
     - A **short introduction** about your partner (e.g., their name, hobbies, favorite programming language, etc.).  
     - A **Two Truths and a Lie section** where you write three statements (two true, one false) about your partner.  

5. **Styling Suggestions:**  
   - Use CSS to style the page. Examples:  
     - Set a background color or gradient for the page.  
     - Use a custom font for the text.  
     - Add a border or shadow to the "Two Truths and a Lie" section.  
     - Use a hover effect on the "Two Truths and a Lie" statements to reveal which one is false (optional).  
     - Add padding, margins, and spacing to make the page visually appealing.  

6. **Repository Upload:**  
   - Save your files (`about_me.html` and `style.css`) in your personal repository within the organization.  
   - Upload your work whether completed or not before the activity ends.  

7. **Sharing:**  
   - At the end of the activity, everyone will have the opportunity to showcase their work.  

## Deliverables  
- **HTML File:** `about_me.html`.  
- **CSS File:** `style.css`.  
- Both files should be uploaded to your personal repository in the organization.
